# HTB_NOTES
Posting my HTB Notes here for CPTS in case Notion went bling bling

**ENUMERATION PRINCIPLES**
1. There is more than meets the eye. Consider all points of view.
2. Distinguish between what we see and what we do not see.
3. There are always ways to gain more information. Understand the target.

Reference:
1. xfreerdp /u:[username] /p:[password] /v:[ip_address]
2. xfreerdp /u:username /p:password /v:localhost:1234 /dynamic-resolution +clipboard /drive:linux,/home/htb-ac12345/
3. remmina -p rdp://user@IP:port
